# NetHack-2021


# AIM
Designing an agent which can navigate the procedurally generated, ascii dungeons of Nethack  :trophy: 

# Objectives :basecamp:	
Automate the end-to-end trading using zerodha platfom using some indicators depending on the stock or options

### Todos (Feel free to add if you feel anything is missing):heavy_plus_sign:	

- [ ] Develop a policy that favors the agent almost all the time.
- [ ] Model based vs Model free, battle for best
- [ ] Mix N Match different policies
- [ ] Make three independent agents where the third is a mix of the two.
- [ ] If using NN, optimize it using Neural Magic - Reduces inference time
- [ ] Maybe use stable baselines
