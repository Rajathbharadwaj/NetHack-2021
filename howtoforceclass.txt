Here's how to install the mod to force a specific class in NLE.
Go to envs/wrappers.py and add to it the code under the --APPENDIX--
Go to submission_config.py.
Where it says "from envs.wrappers import addtimelimitwrapper_fn", also have it import force_class.
Then, set MAKE_ENV_FN in the body of the file to force_class.
Now, you can go to envs/wrappers.py anytime and change TO_FORCE to whatever you want!

TO_FORCE = "wiz"

    """

    Should return a gym env which wraps the nethack gym env
    """
    env = aicrowd_gym.make("NetHackChallenge-v0",character=TO_FORCE)
    env = TimeLimit(env, max_episode_steps=10_000_000)
    return env
