# The value of a permafood is determined by the following:
# -> Its nutrition/weight ratio (higher ratio = more value)
# -> Total nutrition of permafoods in inventory (more nutrition = lower value)
	# -> Foods with secondary effects, like lizard corpses, are treated as lower nutrition for this purpose
# -> Whether the agent is satiated (satiated = lower value)
# -> Whether the agent has slow digestion (slow digestion = lower value)
